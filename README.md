# 📝 Conditional Filtering in Pandas

This repository 📦 contains Python 🐍 code snippets illustrating the use of conditional filtering in Pandas. Conditional filtering is a crucial technique when working with data using the Pandas library, allowing you to extract specific subsets of your dataset based on various conditions.

## Table of Contents 📋

Here's a breakdown of the topics covered in this repository:

1. **Loading Data with Pandas**:
    - Reading a CSV file, 'tips.csv', into a Pandas DataFrame, `df`.
    - Displaying the first few rows of the DataFrame using `df.head()`.

2. **Filtering by Single Condition**:
    - Creating a Boolean Series, `bool_series`, to filter rows where the 'total_bill' is greater than $40.
    - Extracting rows where the 'sex' column is 'Male'.
    - Filtering rows where the 'size' is greater than 3.

3. **Combining Multiple Conditions**:
    - Using `&` (AND) and `|` (OR) operators to filter data based on multiple conditions.
    - Examples of combining conditions for filtering.

4. **Real-World Examples**:
    - Demonstrating practical scenarios where conditional filtering can be applied, such as filtering rows with a total bill greater than $30 or rows where the 'sex' is 'Male'.
    - Filtering rows based on specific days ('Sun', 'Sat', 'Fri').
